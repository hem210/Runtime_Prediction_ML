# Runtime_Prediction_ML
Runtime Prediction of a code using Machine Learning

This project was a done under the guidance of Prof. Amit Mankodi under my BTech Mini Project at DA-IICT.

The objective is to predict the runtime of a code which is based on the evolution and propagation of Plasma in a 2D space with a defined area of interest using Machine Learning Techniques. 

This project uses the L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, and the CPU clock speed of the system as features. But more properties like processor speed and disk I/O speed can be included.
